# Central Dogma Project
In Molecular Biology, the Central Dogma is described as the process of passing genetic information within a biological system. In essence, it is the process of using DNA to produce RNA, which is then used to create proteins. The step of transcribing RNA from DNA is crucial, as the process cannot go from DNA to protein without first creating RNA.

The process of using DNA to create RNA is called transcription. In the process, every instance of Adenine ('A') is replaced with Uracil ('U'). The next step is called translation, which is the process of reading an RNA sequence in order to produce a protein, which is made up of amino acids. In an RNA sequence, a codon, which is made up of 3 nucleotides, translates into an amino acid. For this reason, we read a sequence of RNA in triplets.

These proteins are essential for all the cells in the human body, so the Central Dogma is extremely important. In the study of Bioinformatics, this biological process is interpreted using computer code. In this project, we will replicate the process of DNA replication, transcription, and translation using Python as our programming language.
